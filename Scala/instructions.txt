first goto your project folder outside "src" and then run 
$sbt compile
then do
$sbt run 
for most programs 
for programs like wordCountProgram after compilation do 
$sbt "run src/main/scala/file.txt"
thats almost all i know about this

tip: make seperate directories for each program
tip: put the ".scala" program inside "src/main/scala" always
tip: run command from the directory exactly outside of src folder
